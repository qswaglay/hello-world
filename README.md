# hello-world
Hi everyone,
I am learning programing now. Today is a very beautiful day, very sunny and bright.
I am sitting in a coffee shop, try to learn and understand GitHub, computer programing.
I have so much homework to do and I have a headache now.
I am back editing it again.
I need to have lots of coffee.
